# PlaylistLab
#### This is a React application developed by three students from McGill School of Continuing Studies during their Advanced React class as part of the JavaScript Full Stack Development program.

With PlaylistLab, you can explore the **Deezer API** and search for your
          favorite songs to create personalized playlists. The application
          provides a straightforward interface for searching and adding tracks,
          allowing you to easily curate your own collection of music. Designed
          and developed by **Jingwen Bai, Mourad Latoui, and Junior Vigneault,**
          Playlist Lab serves as a demonstration of key concepts in React. Our
          team has worked diligently to build and style the application,
          showcasing our proficiency in React development.
